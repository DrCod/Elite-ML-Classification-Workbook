    "The basic idea behind KNN is simple. Given a (test) vector or image to classify or label, find  k  vectors or images in Train Set that are \"closest\" to the (test) vector or image. With the  k  closest vectors or images, there are  k  labels. Assign the most frequent label of  k  labels to the (test) vector or image.\n",

In the case of Fashion MNIST, we compute \"closeness\" metric of the vector from Test Set to every element, i.e., 60000 of them, in the Train Set and this will result in 60000 distance values.
